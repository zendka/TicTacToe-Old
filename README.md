# Tic-tac-toe
This is an implementation of Tic-tac-toe (Noughts and Crosses).
The computer is unbeatable.

## Implementation
It represents the grid as a matrix as it's the most obvious way. An alternative is to use an array which would make for shorter but less intuitive code.
The grid state is stored using the values of the matrix as it's the most obvious way. An alternative would be to store each player's marks into sets which will make for shorter but slightly less intuitive code.
