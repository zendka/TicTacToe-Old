 * Tic-tac-toe is played by two players who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid
 * using X (for the 1st player) and O (for the 2nd)
 * The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
 *
 * Assumption: the 1st player (using X) is always the human
